This is a **parallel computing implementation** of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in MATLAB.

It is based on [https://yarpiz.com/50/ypea102-particle-swarm-optimization](https://yarpiz.com/50/ypea102-particle-swarm-optimization), and hunshcn make it parallel.

Compared with the original version, this version will slow down the convergence speed, but due to parallel computing, the time cost will actually be greatly reduced.

Notes:

You can turn off Hyper-Threading Technology, so that matlab can make better use of cpu resources.
